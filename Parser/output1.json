		"Program Summary": "ISSUE: Accessing Federal Veterans benefits is complex and the wait time to obtain a decision can be long thereby delaying access to needed benefits for Veterans and their families.PROGRAM GOAL: The goals of Veterans Services are to provide information, assistance, and advocacy to all who served in the military in order to improve their access to pension, disability, and health benefits. Veterans Services leverage strong community partnerships, resulting in increased community referrals for underrepresented Veterans.PROGRAM ACTIVITY: Veterans Service Officers (VSOs) are trained and accredited by the Oregon Department of Veterans Affairs to represent Veterans and their families in their claims for benefits. VSOs are versed in applicable Federal and State laws to provide the best representation possible, free of charge. VSOs provide comprehensive counseling on Veterans Administration (VA) benefits; assist with VA healthcare enrollment; prepare and submit claims for VA compensation and pension; initiate and develop appeals; network with Federal, State, and local agencies; and provide outreach to Veterans involved with the justice system. ADVSD has committed to supporting Veterans by leading the Countys Veterans Services Task Force to strengthen the network of community partners. The Veterans Service Office is also a supporting partner in  A Home for Everyone efforts to end chronic homelessness for Veterans through participation in the By Name List, a registry for Veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. This effort increases awareness about VSOs and the services they provide in assisting Veterans to navigate the claims process as quickly and smoothly as possible. VSOs promote equity to Veterans and military families identified within underrepresented communities who face barriers to access Federal, State, and local benefits. The VSOs help Veterans apply for various services with different eligibility standards and conduct over 2,300 annual face-to-face appointments. At any given point in time the VSOs are serving over 8,100 Veterans in Multnomah County. The VSOs implement intentional and targeted outreach with multiple access options for LGBTQ Veterans, women Veterans, Veterans within communities of color, Veterans experiencing homelessness, justice-involved Veterans, as well as Veterans and military families experiencing socio-economic disparities.",

The demand for PGC services is increasing due to the aging population and the rising incidence of abuse and neglect among older adults and people with disabilities.PROGRAM GOAL: The goal of PGC is to provide legal protection and access to services and benefits while promoting the health and welfare for those served by minimizing unnecessary emergency department or hospital visits and arranging for needed medical, mental health, and residential care. The PGC program is an essential part of the Countys response system to reduce financial fraud, abuse, and neglect when legal authority is required. PGC supports the DCHS strategy to reduce abuse and neglect in order to improve independence, health, and safety.PROGRAM ACTIVITY: Public guardians serve as the court-appointed representative for adults with mental incapability with an IQ below 70, severe and persistent mental illness, Alzheimer's, and other dementias or brain injury. PGC participants are also functionally incapacitated, requiring intensive supports and specialized housing arrangements to balance the need for protection with the right to autonomy. Person-centered care plans address immediate risks, ensure adequate care arrangements, and stabilize medical and psychiatric conditions by achieving personal goals through community engagement. Public guardians are available 24/7 to make medical, psychiatric, financial, and life decisions for participants. The average caseload is between 35-39 participants monthly, consistent with national standards. Public guardians also provide community consultation for individuals who may not meet the legal or program criteria for needing a guardian yet still need assistance to find less restrictive alternatives. They provide information and services and identify less restrictive alternatives to address problems. Program staff train community partners and work with Adult Protective Services, families, community partners, law enforcement, hospitals, multi-disciplinary teams, and the court to intervene early to resolve fraud, abuse, and neglect of vulnerable adults. PGC participates on multi-disciplinary teams and provides case consultation to identify alternatives to public guardianship.",

The Multnomah County Circuit Court, Probate Department now mandates completion of the education class for newly appointed fiduciaries. Participants are required to pay a fee for the class and fee waivers are available through a court approval process.  Approximately 1,500 fiduciaries are completing the class annually in Multnomah County. Trained volunteers monitor and conduct visits with individuals under guardianship, offering support to fiduciaries and submitting reports to the court for further review as necessary. Monitors frequently provide resources to further assist all parties involved with the protected individual and court action resulting in restoration of rights has resulted in a number of cases upon further review by the court.  The program has volunteers in five counties.  65% of all their monitoring visits occur in Multnomah County.",

A key component of the MDT program is the mental health direct services. In  2014, a Portland State University study describes an overall lack of access to needed mental health services for older adults and people with disabilities. Through MDT referrals, a mental health specialist provides in-home screening, assessment and counseling to participants. A reduction of services would mean that isolated, and often homebound older adults would lack critical connection to their needed services. Such a reduction would also limit the ability to involve a mental health specialist during consultation and coordination of services for these same adults. This program offer retains services at the current level, addressing reductions in mental health services that occurred in the transfer from the Health Department.

		"Program Summary": "ISSUE: As the federally designated Area Agency on Aging, ADVSD is charged by the Older Americans Act and the State of Oregon to conduct a community needs assessment every four years. When examining the general older adult population, community need remains relatively static, so a more targeted approach is necessary to understand the needs of racially, ethnically and culturally diverse communities. Understanding regional population changes and migration effects of gentrification on program need and utilization will help planning efforts. PROGRAM GOAL: The Older Adult Area Plan development is a key activity of the division. In order to develop the most informed plan, deep community engagement is essential. The last Area Plan was developed through a broad outreach effort, including 18 community listening sessions and 474 unique participants. These groups were facilitated by ADVSD staff. For the new plan the goal is to contract with culturally specific organizations to lead the community engagement activities, gaining an even deeper level of feedback from culturally specific communities and help analyze in a culturally specific way. PROGRAM ACTIVITY:  ADVSD will contract with Portland State University for a research fellow to get the most current and detailed demographic data of the community.  This data will inform a contracting process that will provide opportunity for Culturally Specific organizations to lead the community needs assessment activity, within their communities.  ADVSD used the Equity and Empowerment Lens to identify the need for increased engagement and leadership of racially and culturally diverse communities in developing the Area Plan.",

		"Program Summary": "ISSUE: The cost of legal representation can be prohibitive for survivors who have low or no income and have been financially exploited by their abusers. There are very few resources for legal assistance available for survivors with low incomes. As a result, survivors of domestic violence often are forced to appear in court without representation or legal advocacy. Domestic violence survivors and provider agencies report that civil legal services are one of the highest unmet needs for domestic violence survivors. PROGRAM GOAL:  The goal of the program is to reduce domestic violence by providing civil legal advocacy and civil legal services to help survivors to safely end abusive relationships and resolve issues that cannot be addressed by human service or criminal justice interventions.  PROGRAM ACTIVITY:  Program activities focus on the provision of legal assistance. Civil legal assistance is related to the reduction in reported domestic violence crimes and improves the likelihood that survivors will be able to obtain protective orders from courts, which is a significant factor in reducing rates of violence. These specialized legal services for domestic and sexual violence survivors ensure better outcomes in legal proceedings. These include assistance with restraining order hearings, custody and parenting time determinations, housing retention, immigration matters, and related victims rights and other civil legal matters.

Increased access to social services and additional learning opportunities outside of, but connected to the classroom, are promising practices for reducing the achievement gap. The Youth Advocacy Program provides this link in schools and in the community.PROGRAM ACTIVITY: Advocates support and mentor youth, building a strong supportive relationship with them through intensive individual support. Key services include case management with a focus on academic and life goals; advocacy in disciplinary and educational meetings; skill-building groups; academic support activities such as tutoring, mentoring, reading club, gender-specific groups, and conflict resolution classes; and parent outreach/engagement. Youth advocates work in collaboration with SUN Community Schools and other school personnel towards youth and family success. Participants in the Youth Advocacy Program are at risk for academic failure due to poor attendance, failing grades, language barriers, family instability, and school disproportionate discipline. Ninety-five percent of youth served are youth of color or from a culturally specific community.  Youth Advocacy targets six specific populations of youth and families of color: African American, African Immigrant, Asian Pacific Islander, Latino, Native American, and Slavic. ",

		"Program Summary": "ISSUE: Families with low incomes, families of color, and immigrants and refugees face barriers and have fewer opportunities to participate in services that support parenting knowledge and healthy child development. This contributes significantly to disparities in kindergarten readiness levels and, ultimately, in school success. Multnomah County has 34,000 children under the age of six in families with low incomes. PROGRAM GOAL: PCDSs goals are to improve positive parenting skills, ensure the healthy development of young children, and increase kindergarten readiness for families with children under the age of six. The program utilizes the evidence-based Parents As Teachers (PAT) curriculum which has been proven to produce the results that PCDS seeks.PROGRAM ACTIVITY: PCDS creates opportunities for parents to interact with their children in mentored settings with child development specialists. Specific services include home visits that focus on parenting education, age-appropriate parent-child playgroups, support services, developmental screening, immunization status checks and follow up and access to other social and health services. The Ages and Stages child development screening tool is used to determine the developmental stage. Children who do not meet the appropriate stage for their age are referred for intervention services. PCDS services are delivered in families' homes, communities and schools. In recent years, the program has made several changes to improve outcomes, including engaging families when their children are younger, increasing the duration of service and the number of home visits families receive in the first year, developing a new parent survey to understand impact; and intentionally connecting families to appropriate preschool or Head Start programs to strengthen children's readiness for kindergarten.

EKT increases familiarity with school routines and staff develops socio-emotional skills in children and promotes family-school relationships. Research shows a strong correlation between successful kindergarten transition and overall success in elementary school for the child, their parent/caregiver, the kindergarten teacher, and other students in the class. Children who had no early childhood education experience were one and a half times more likely to be chronically absent during kindergarten compared to those enrolled in EKT.EKT is a school-based summer program with two core components: 1) Kindergarten class time for children led by a kindergarten teacher and 2) Family engagement activities that include a facilitated parent/caregiver group and other activities intended to promote positive family-school relationships, including following up with participating families after the start of the school year. The program specifically focuses on recruiting children of color and English Language Learners who have not had prior preschool experience so that they will be more successful in school. EKT is a partnership with Early Learning Multnomah across six school districts, SUN Community School Lead Agencies, Portland State University (PSU), the SUN Service System and Multnomah County Library to support the successful transition into kindergarten. Research by PSU has fostered a continuous improvement approach to study the program elements during implementation and make adjustments to the program model in the subsequent year to be more effective.

		"Program Summary": "ISSUE: Healthy child development is foundational to our communitys overall health, well-being, and vibrancy. Research shows that over 80 percent of a childs brain is developed by the time theyve reached age 5, and that investing early in a childs development can significantly reduce the opportunity gap in education, chance of entering the criminal justice system, need for remedial education, and other types of costly interventions. In Multnomah County, there are approximately 64,000 children under the age of 6, and about 19,000 3 and 4 year olds (preschool aged children). One of the most effective returns on investments a community can make is in early learning programs. These investments decrease systemic inequities and disparities between children and allow for needed interventions to begin as early as possible. Research shows that access to high quality preschool can ensure that children are ready to learn when they enter kindergarten, and then stay on track throughout their education. PROGRAM GOAL: Building on the work completed by the Preschool for All Task Force in 2018-2019, the next phase includes conducting further analysis on cost, revenue generation, and implementation needs. This funding will also support DCHS staff time to engage in community outreach and education about the work of the Task Force to build a coalition around expanding preschool access in Multnomah County.   PROGRAM ACTIVITIES: The Preschool for All Task Force has significant momentum and strong collaboration with over  50 organizations in the community. The report completed by the Task Force will outline recommendations on a preschool program model, curriculum, evaluation standards, teacher credentials and compensation, infrastructure planning, finance and administrative oversight. Ongoing funding allows for the continued engagement of high level leaders, further analyses that are needed for the next phase of this project as implementation becomes more feasible, and further engagement and outreach to the broader community on the key recommendations.

Early childhood service and education systems, funding and services are not aligned and coordinated in such a way that families have the culturally appropriate supports they need to support their children as they transition into kindergarten. PROGRAM GOAL: The goal of the Early Learning Family and School Transition supports is to create opportunities for children to more successfully transition to kindergarten - and to meaningfully involve their parent/caregiver in that transition. These supports are built into the SUN Community School where staff have trusted relationships and deep connections to the community.PROGRAM ACTIVITY: This program area has two primary components: kindergarten teacher home visits and parent engagement prior to and during the early elementary school years (also known as Prenatal to third grade, or P-3). The Kindergarten Teacher Family Visit project creates opportunities for kindergarten teachers to visit homes before children enter school. This builds parent and teacher connection early on so that parents feel more comfortable in the school environment and teachers understand the parent/caregiver's hopes for their child. The Kindergarten Partnership & Innovation grant from Early Learning Multnomah supports P-3 Schools, which provides parent engagement at 8 SUN Community Schools, connecting families to school before kindergarten and fostering parent leadership. This builds on research showing that when schools actively engage and connect parents in culturally appropriate ways, their children do better in school. These strategies link partners from the early learning and K-12 systems so that all partners are building a smooth transition from early learning to early grades.",

		"Program Summary": "Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in Multnomah County and across the nation.  Although cigarette smoking has declined in Multnomah County, disparities in tobacco use remain across groups defined by race, ethnicity, educational level, and socioeconomic status. Nearly 1,274 residents die prematurely from tobacco use each year, and more than 23,395 suffer from a disease caused by smoking. Despite these risks, approximately 114,750 Multnomah County adults currently smoke cigarettes while the youth of Multnomah County currently report e-cigarette use at higher rates than cigarettes. And the harmful effects of smoking do not end with the smoker. Secondhand smoke exposure causes serious disease and death, and even brief exposure can be harmful to health. Coupled with this enormous health toll is the significant economic burden. Currently an estimated $233.9 million is spent on tobacco-related medical costs and $187.5 million is lost in productivity due to premature tobacco-related deaths.Components of the program include: implementation of equitable strategies to reduce youth access to, and use of, tobacco and nicotine products, establishment of policy/regulation, counter-marketing, promotion of smokefree environments, providing support and resources to smokers who want to quit, surveillance and evaluation, and engaging diverse communities in tobacco prevention efforts in order to reduce tobacco-related disparities. Tobacco retail licensing components include: annual compliance inspections, minimum legal sales age inspections, enforcement inspections, surveillance and monitoring, trainings, outreach and consultation in order to increase retailer compliance with all laws related to the sale of tobacco and nicotine products in order to decrease access and availability of these products within Multnomah County.",

		"Program Summary": "Vector control and code enforcement are core public health services. Multnomah Countys climate supports ideal mosquito and rat habitats. International airport and shipping along with migratory bird flyways provide avenues for new diseases to enter the community. Mosquito control began in the county in the 1930s, when malaria was endemic. In 2018, five counties in Oregon reported 58 mosquito-cases of West Nile Virus. There were no cases detected in Multnomah County. It is necessary to maintain current levels of surveillance and control to ensure early prevention and suppression of this and other vector-borne diseases using World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control best practices. Rodent control is critical to public health. Rodents can spread Hantavirus, plague and other diseases and can affect livability. A survey in the county rat population showed Toxoplasmosis (Cat Box Fever) in 6% of the rat population. Vector Control protects the community by serving all populations, while focusing on the vulnerable (i.e. elderly, children, homeless). The citizenry understands and expects these program functions. The Vector programs major components include mosquito control; rodent control; and nuisance code enforcement. Mosquito control comprises the majority of the programs funds/staffing. The program is the primary provider of rodent control in the county. Nuisance code enforcement addresses public health code violations, including restaurant enforcement and dumping. The programs main activities include collecting and identifying mosquitoes, birds, and rats; monitoring for and responding to emerging vector-borne disease such as Zika virus and now-endemic West Nile Virus; performing laboratory analysis on rats and mosquitoes to determine what species carry disease, their preferred habitats, and population size; abating/suppressing mosquitoes that carry West Nile Virus with pesticides with the least impact; reducing the mosquito breeding habitat through water control and vegetation management; and educating the average citizen and vulnerable populations about preventing vectors and their habitat through community meetings, pamphlets and the media.

An electronic birth and death data certification model was implemented requiring a significant increase in individual education with community partners. The Vital Records program provides reliable information for decision-making in public health so that populations at risk for poor health outcomes are identified to receive proactive interventions. For example, pregnant women were identified as being at greater risk for death from H1N1 influenza by reviewing hospitalization data and death certificates. As a result, physicians and clinical services providing care to pregnant women were prioritized for receipt of vaccine, averting deaths in this high risk population. Also, the program assures accurate, timely and confidential registration of birth and death events minimizing the opportunity for identity theft and assuring accurate record of cause of death and the identification of parents of the born child.",

WIC provides nutritious food, nutrition education and counseling, growth monitoring, health screening, peer breastfeeding support, and networks of support to eligible families. These services strive to have lasting effects so families enjoy better nutrition and health throughout their lives.Early life nutrition affects every aspect of health across the life course. Evaluation of WIC has demonstrated that families on WIC are in overall better health and have less food insecurity when they are on the program. WIC mothers have a 25% reduced risk for preterm birth and 44% lower risk for low birth weight babies, resulting in better health and less chronic disease throughout their lives. For every dollar spent on a pregnant woman in WIC, up to $4.21 is saved in Medicaid costs. Supporting families in their breastfeeding goals is another key focus area for WIC. Breastfeeding provides immunity protection to infants, health benefits to the mother, and lifelong risk reduction for important chronic diseases. Breastfeeding promotion at WIC and the Breastfeeding Peer Counseling (BFPC) program use an evidence-based support model that is effective for the County's most vulnerable families who experience significant economic and racial disparities in breastfeeding. WIC served over 21,700 different clients last year with multiple visits and provided access to other support services including prenatal and children's healthcare, immunizations, Head Start, housing and day care assistance, social services, referrals to other County public health programs, SNAP and other food assistance. WIC acts as a core referral center for other health and social services and is key in enrolling families in Medicaid and private insurance and other early childhood programs. The 18 full time nutrition provider staff conducted 49,614 visits in 2018. WIC's emphasis on prenatal health and early childhood helps the County support health over the life course and reduce health inequities. For example, 27% of WIC clients do not speak English and, in a given month, WIC serves 3,813 clients who speak 40 languages other than English.

Care that addresses patients' beliefs and culture is more likely to succeed in improving and maintaining their health. MCHC is tightly linked with refugee resettlement agencies (i.e., SOAR, IRCO, Catholic Charities, Lutheran Community Services), the Centers of Disease Control and the State of Oregon. About 80% of all clients are immigrants or were refugees (Ukraine, Afghanistan, DRC, Burman, Russia, Latin America, Kosovo, etc.). Staff represent approximately 25 different countries and more than 60% of the MCHC staff speak a second language. Many of the staff are immigrants and a few were refugees themselves. MCHC services are designed specifically to prevent people from needing more costly and often less appropriate care while addressing the social determinants of health. The immigrant and refugee populations often receive little preventative care at home, leading to a disproportionately high rate of serious medical conditions (ie. diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, cancer). Many client families have three or more children; often with serious health problems (ie. asthma, diabetes, poor nutrition, no dental care, post-traumatic stress, etc.) which impact their schooling and development. This program helps them with pediatric and prenatal services as well as referrals. Many children receive their first complete set of vaccines at MCHC. ",

ASHEP uses public health and social determinate data to identify geographic areas and specific populations at highest need for focused resources. Locally, significant sexual and reproductive health inequities exist among Latinx, Native Americans, and African Americans. LGBTQ youth populations are also disproportionately impacted by violence and sexually transmitted infection when compared to the county as a whole. Both health inequities and trauma related to violence can interrupt education and limit future opportunities impacting the long-term fertility and health of youth. In FY20, ASHEP will reach over 7,000 youth.ASHEP partners with youth, educators, caregivers, and service providers in school and community settings. Oregon law requires comprehensive sexuality and healthy relationship skill education for youth; development and adoption of child sexual abuse prevention programs for students in grades K-12; and that all youth, regardless of income, citizenship status, gender identity or type of insurance, have access to the full range of preventive reproductive health services. ASHEP plays a key role in supporting schools to meet this goal, and to help ensure community members have the information and support systems needed to access and advocate for their own health care. ASHEP trains educators and adult mentors in evidence-based and evidence informed sexual and relationship health curricula and teen-dating violence prevention curricula. ASHEP staff evaluate programs and adapt/translate curricula to provide effective education to special populations. ASHEP Health Educators also reach high-need youth not enrolled in mainstream public schools. Together ASHEP staff and community partners work to strengthen community resilience, address inequities, and support culturally-specific and responsive efforts. The capacity of African American, Latino, and Native American communities is increased by training, collaborating, and providing technical support to partner organizations to provide culturally-specific skill building, policy advocacy, and community mobilization among both youth and their parents/caring adults.",

The Public Health Division received a new round of REACH funding in FY19 that builds upon the partnerships and strategies developed during the previous cycle of REACH funding (2014-2018). REACH will continue to be a central component to the Health Departments commitment to equity by addressing the ways that societal conditions, built environment, and systems and policies create health disparities among racial and ethnic populations. This work entails developing and maintaining authentic partnerships with culturally-specific community based organizations, clients, faith-based organizations, civic organizations, and local governments to enact approaches and policies to decrease health inequities. REACHs culturally-tailored programming addresses preventable risk behaviors (i.e., tobacco use, poor nutrition, and physical inactivity) to improve health, prevent chronic disease, and reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic populations with the highest risk/burden of chronic disease (i.e. hypertension, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and obesity). In FY20, there are three main REACH program areas focused on local Black/African American communities: nutrition, physical activity, and community-clinical linkages.

The Nurse Family Partnership Program (NFP) is a nurse home visiting program offered to first-time, low-income pregnant women through two Multnomah County teams located in Northeast Portland and East County. Home visiting services begin in early pregnancy and follow families up to their child's second birthday. NFP consistently demonstrates improved prenatal health, fewer childhood injuries, increased intervals between births, increased maternal employment, and improved school readiness for children. Multnomah County has developed infrastructure that ensures fidelity to the NFP model and includes extensive staff training, reflective supervision, a Community Advisory Council, and rigorous evaluation support through the NFP National Service Office. Long-term benefits to the county include healthy children ready to learn; decreased costs related to fewer families involved in child welfare and juvenile justice systems, and over the long-term families less affected by chronic disease. Nurse Family Partnership is connected with the Healthy Birth Initiative (HBI). This partnership provides African American first-time mothers who are enrolled in NFP with all of the wraparound, culturally-specific services and leadership development of the HBI program.

An approach to addressing underlying conditions of health at particular times in a person's life, also known as the life course perspective, suggests that the stress resulting from disproportionate exposure to risk factors at key developmental points throughout one's life, and from generation to generation, can accumulate in one's body before conception and increase the risk for negative birth outcomes for the next generation.The Baby Booster project improves Maternal, Child and Family health outcomes in the Lents neighborhood of east Portland through a concerted focus on the first thousand days of life. The efforts of the Baby Booster work focuses on addressing community articulated priorities (mainly anti-displacement efforts in the 97266 area) to reduce stressful events that cause cumulative health impacts particularly for parenting aged adults and very young children in their first thousand days of life.The Baby Booster anchor agency convenes multi-agency collaborations in the 97266 zip code to develop a community-driven collective impact initiative with four focus areas as identified by communities in the 97266 zip code and in the Multnomah County Community Health Improvement Plan. The focus areas address housing, food, healthcare and jobs at a systems level as a means to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in Maternal, Child and Family Health outcomes. These efforts are needed in Multnomah County to address the underlying conditions which can impact health and health outcomes. FY20 will continue support for the partnership, expand the housing preference to other ROSE Community Development properties and to future Rose CDC development projects, and resource development to sustain the Best Baby Zone in the 97266 zip code of southeast Portland.",

The program supports racial equity approaches by prioritizing screening families of color and low income communities and directing these families to programs prepared to address their specific needs. Long-term benefits to the County include reduced racial inequities and increased numbers of healthy children who enter kindergarten ready to learn, a healthier workforce and decreased costs to County systems by preventing future child welfare involvement, school absenteeism, juvenile crime and chronic disease. HFMC has two components: 1) Welcome Baby screens families for service eligibility and refers families who may be experiencing risk indicators for parent stress. 2) HFMC home visiting delivers the accredited, evidence-based Healthy Families America model, delivered by highly trained staff at community-based agencies. Home visiting teams have a culturally-specific focus, including African American, immigrant/refugee, Latino families, teen parents, and parents with significant substance abuse or trauma history. The HFMC program also maximizes a number of partnerships and is guided by a Maternal Child and Family Health Advisory Council. Example partnerships inclue the Healthy Birth Initiatives to improve services for African American families; We Are Home, a collaboration with the Oregon Community Health Worker Association to support immigrant refugee families through community-driven, culturally-specific approaches to maternal child family health services; and Early Learning Multnomah (ELM), a collaboration of over 50 early learning programs; and Health Share of Oregon to develop and pilot a tri-county early childhood resource referral and service database to close service gaps for at risk families.

The African American community experiences the most severe inequities across the spectrum of perinatal health, including a rate of low birth weight at twice that of White non-Hispanics. African American babies in Multnomah County are born too soon, too small, and die too early. These are some of the worst health outcome disparities in the county and, therefore, the Health Department recognizes the work of HBI as part of its core public health mission. HBI uses a family-centered approach that engages mothers, fathers, and other caretakers in supporting a child's development. Components of HBI include case management, health education, community engagement, service coordination, and collective impact. HBI nurses utilize the Nurse Family Partnerships model as a key component of home visiting services. Other evidence-based models, in addition to Nurse Family Partnerships, include Centering Pregnancy; Smoking Cessation and Reduction in Pregnancy Treatment (SCRIPT); Parents as Teachers (PAT); Partners in Parenting Education (PIPE); 24/7 Dads, among others. HBI care coordination is promoted between internal Health Department programs, external health and social service providers, and larger health systems. HBI works with its Community Action Network (CAN) to achieve collective impact on topics such as breastfeeding, family planning, and male/father involvement. The CAN is led by parents and comprised of a number of healthcare, social-service, and culturally specific agencies working together to implement community-identified strategies.

Locally, geographic areas with socioeconomic disparities (higher poverty, lower educational attainment, and neighborhoods subjected to disinvestment and/or gentrification) also have significant health disparities, including for chronic diseases and exposure to violence and trauma. In fact, researchers recognize violence (the experience with and/or fear of) as a risk factor for a range of physical health issues, including chronic diseases. CDVP programs engage and work alongside community partners to prevent and improve these health and social inequities by nurturing neighborhoods to support healthy and safe gathering spaces, worksites, schools, health care, and physical environments. Strategies support the work of other Public Health Division prevention programs by addressing the leading causes of death and disability through a health equity framework that reaches neighborhoods and communities most impacted by disparities. Chronic diseases prevention (CDP) work compliments and augments strategies implemented in the Office of the Director, REACH, Community Powered Change/CHIP, and Tobacco Control and Prevention. CDP provides capacity and flexibility to fill critical gaps in prevention efforts that State and Federal funding are not able to support. Activities are focused on increasing access to healthy eating, active living, and smoke/nicotine-free environments by advancing community/neighborhood policy and systems changes; reaching youth/adolescents in a variety of school and recreation settings; and addressing factors that create socioeconomic disparities, particularly poverty and educational attainment. Violence prevention work is led by STRYVE (Striving to Reduce Youth Violence Everywhere), which employs a public health approach to violence prevention grounded in equity, healing, and resilience. STRYVE prevents youth violence though community health workers who are reflective of the population and work in partnership with youth and adults to address community trauma, increase resilience, youth empowerment and leadership, and build system capacity. Activities include improving neighborhood livability through community-led projects; providing summer employment programs for youth; and maintaining relationships with national experts to guide local systems with emerging best practices.

		"Program Summary": "The harm reduction program works with people who may not be ready to stop substance use, offering strategies to reduce risks and negative outcomes for people who inject drugs (PWID) and those around them. While syringes are legal for purchase in Oregon, 70% of program clients report homelessness/unstable housing and rely on low barrier access to services and supplies offered through Harm Reduction programming. Services incorporate trauma-informed risk reduction counseling and referrals based on readiness for change. Strategies include promoting one-time use of new, sterile syringes and other supplies, which are crucial to prevent hepatitis C, HIV, and hepatitis B transmission. The Harm Reduction program offers access to services at the field-based and clinical site. These access points mitigate barriers faced by PWID, such as the stigma associated with drug use and housing status, through an approach focused on building trusting relationships. Sites offer syringe exchange and addictions education and resources, including access to an addictions benefit coordinator. The clinical site also provides low barrier wound/abscess care, and sexual health services for people not typically engaged in health care. Currently, the Oregon Health Plan is expanding hepatitis C treatment access to PWID, among others. The program will optimize this opportunity to engage clients in HCV/HIV testing and linkage to treatment.  Opioid overdose prevention and naloxone distribution (a medication that reverses overdoses) help clients, first responders, and other community members recognize and respond to an overdose. While prescription drug overdose (OD) deaths recently declined in Oregon, statewide data shows an increase in OD death due to illicit drugs. Multnomah County has the highest OD death rates in Oregon, but opioid OD has declined each year since the advent of naloxone distribution, a reduction not seen nationally or in local counties with limited naloxone access. Harm Reduction clients reported 913 OD reversals in FY18, an increase of 22.7%. To support overdoses prevention efforts, staff provide regional and statewide technical assistance and capacity building training, allowing local community-based organizations to buy naloxone through the program. Staff also work with partners to coordinate system-level strategies. ",

It is a critical component in a full continuum of mental health services. Although it works with other community agencies that provide long term-care, the mission of the sub-acute facility is brief intervention when a person becomes a danger to themselves or others due to his/her mental illness. The target length of stay is 6 days. Since the individual remains linked to the community, length-of-stay is minimized and the person is less likely to lose critical recovery supports including Medicaid eligibility and housing. Subacute care is less expensive than hospitalization. Incarceration hinders recovery and strains the resources of courts and the jail. As part of a best practice model for facilities of this type, the proposed treatment team includes consumer positions on staff (Peer Support Specialists) to provide mentoring and linkage to services in the community. These positions are salaried members of the treatment team.",

If a person is found to have a mental disorder, and due to that disorder, are a danger to self/others, or are unable to meet their basic needs a hearing report is filed with the circuit court and civil commitment hearing is held. ORS 426.110-120 requires that a court examiner make an independent recommendation to the judge.Emergency Hold: When an individual is appropriately placed on an E-Hold and cannot pay for the hospital stay, ORS 426 requires that the county pays for these services. The county is required to provide commitment monitoring services. Commitment Monitors: Staff in this unit assess committed individuals to determine whether they continue to meet commitment criteria, work with hospital staff to develop treatment & discharge plans, and make recommendations on continued hospitalization. Commitment monitors perform monitoring services during trial visits to the community, facilitate financial & medical entitlements, and ensure that individuals transition into the appropriate level of community care. In FY12, the state began funding the county to pay for uninsured consumers who are committed and monitored in the hospital by MHASD's commitment monitors. State Hospital Waitlist Reduction Program (WLRP): Funding provides for Intensive Case Management (ICM) for patients discharging from the State Hospital and acute care hospitals, and for three Emergency Department Liaisons.

The diversion programs address the needs of residents experiencing severe mental health issues who can be safely diverted from jail and/or the State Hospital, by providing support for successful completion of court directives as well as providing linkage to community services that increase mental health stability. Initial case management and coordination protects the legal and civil rights of these individuals, ensures appropriateness of resources and decreases the unnecessary expense of time spent in jail or the State Hospital.The Community Court Program works with defendants who have been involved in low-level quality of life crimes. The focus is on restorative justice and clients are able to participate in a variety of social services as an alternative to jail or community service. Mental Health Court provides time-limited intensive monitoring services to persons involved in the criminal justice system post-adjudication. Defendants plea into the court and are supported by Parole/probation, mental health court monitors and peer specialists. The focus is on connecting defendants to community treatment, housing, and financial and medical entitlements. Staff provides ongoing monitoring and support for persons enrolled in the Mental Health Court. Staff initiated services to 60 new participants in FY18.  The Forensic Diversion Program is a pre-adjudication program, focusing on diverting mentally ill defendants from the criminal justice system. The program also works with persons charged with felonies and misdemeanors and ordered to undergo evaluation/restoration at the Oregon State Hospital (OSH). Staff provides mental status evaluations and linkage to basic needs in the community; time-limited coordination/linkage to treatment services, housing, financial and medical entitlements, and social services. In addition, Forensic Diversion provides community restoration as an alternative to being placed in the Oregon State Hospital.

For people who are homeless,addicted, and newly sober, it can be a vital resource in the work towards long-term recovery. Supportive Housing addresses two interwoven challenges: without housing, clients lack the stability necessary to address the problems that lead to homelessness, and without attached supportive services, the client is likely to remain homeless due to unaddressed addiction issues.Supportive housing ($29/day) is an evidence-based, lower-cost resource when compared to either Level 3.7 MedicallyMonitored Inpatient Withdrawal Management ($945/ day) or Level 3.2 A&D Residential treatment ($120/day), and we canprovide less restrictive/expensive outpatient treatment while the individual is in supportive housing. 58 supportive housingunits can each house two to three clients per year (3-4 month stays).

Youth alcohol and drug treatment focuses on the developmental issues of youth, to mitigate the immediate and long-term consequences of substance abuse. Our youth treatment continuum reflects collaboration with schools, juvenile justice, and a network of community-based treatment and recovery support providers. This collaborative network provides outreach/engagement services, outpatient treatment, residential treatment, and recovery support services for youth and families with an income at or less than 200% of Federal Poverty Level.  The Family Alcohol and Drug-Free Network (FAN) is a collaboration of community providers supporting families in 89 units of Central City Concern long-term transitional housing. FAN provides a clean, safe and sober living environment in which parents can raise their children while in a recovery supported environment. FAN offers families an array of services, including: rent assistance, family mentoring, and housing case management. Goals focus on supporting the sobriety and recovery of the parent(s); family reunification in cases of child welfare involvement; supports to enhance family stability, economic self-sufficiency, pro-social/ drug-free relationships and community involvement; and placement in permanent housing. The FAN Housing Coordination program helps those families in early recovery as they transition from residential treatment to locate suitable Alcohol and Drug Free Communities (ADFC) recovery-focused housing, as well as providing assistance with housing maintenance and referrals to other supportive resources. Access to this supportive ADFC housing in turn lays a foundation for families future self-sufficiency and ability to obtain permanent housing. FAN Rent Assistance provides payment of rent and associated expenses inclusive of deposits, move-in costs, and utilities.Altogether, the services embedded within the family and youth addictions treatment continuum are vital to serving youth and families, many of whom struggle with a myriad of challenges such as trauma histories, dual diagnoses, generational cycles of poverty, incarceration, and fragmented family structures among other difficulties.

		"Program Summary": "Every Child staff, who are trained in child development, brain development and early reading research, visit parents and caregivers in social service agencies, childcare centers, Head Start centers, teen parent programs, treatment facilities, and other locations serving adults with children birth to age five. They teach parents and caregivers easy techniques to prepare their preschool children for learning to read. Classes, taught in English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese, show adults how to read, talk, sing, play and rhyme with babies, toddlers and preschoolers so that children develop the pre-reading skills they need before they enter kindergarten.From birth to age five, children go through a critical window for brain development that supports literacy. Reading, talking, singing, playing, writing and rhyming with children during this sensitive time determines a childs future as a reader. Many parents and caregivers dont know how early this window opens  and closes  and how tremendous an impact simple actions can have on their childrens future ability to read. Children must have early experiences with language, books, and writing tools to become successful readers.Research shows that children most at risk for being unprepared for kindergarten are those who live in poverty, have parents who speak a language other than English in the home, have few books in their homes, and whose mothers have limited education and/or low literacy. These children start kindergarten with significantly lower cognitive skills than their more advantaged peers because they likely lacked the opportunity to have rich language and literacy experiences in the five years before they attend school. Every Child Initiative reaches these parents on-site and shows them easy ways to help their children gain pre-reading skills during these important years. Program evaluations show that parents and caregivers gain clear knowledge of their role in their childrens preparedness for reading.",

The TSCC reviews the budgets of all 41 local governments to ensure compliance with local budget law and is responsible for oversight of its 27 member taxing districts. The review and oversight includes checking to see that budgets are balanced, property tax revenue projections are reasonable, and that the budget processes comply with state and local budget laws.  TSCC staff works closely with the county assessor's office as a double check that property tax levies are requested and calculated accurately.  These efforts reduce violations of local budget law, especially if the error results in a property tax levy that exceeds authority.In addition to its legally mandated oversight role, the TSCC offers training and consulting services to member jurisdictions.  Recent examples include:  two TSCC budget training workshops, budget law training at the Spring and Fall Oregon Government Finance Officers Association conference, 11 budget hearings, and five tax measure hearings.  TSCC staff is also active state-wide on budget and property tax issues in both a practitioner role and a legislative advisory role. The Commission considers the citizens to be its primary customers and seeks to make the financial affairs of local governments more transparent and accountable to those citizens.  Funding for the TSCC comes from two sources: member districts, the share of which is calculated by statutory formula, and the state's County Assessment Function Funding Assistance (CAFFA) Grant.  ",

Communities rely on census statistics to plan for a variety of needs including new roads, schools, nutrition and emergency services. Each year, the federal government distributes hundreds of billions of dollars to states and communities based on Census Bureau data.  In 2016, Oregon received $13,452,034,877 through 55 federal spending programs guided by data derived from the 2010 Census.  Communities we dont count well are often some of our most vulnerable populations.  Multnomah Countys Complete Count Committee seeks to engage our natural networks and service touch points across departments, programming, and partnerships.  Strategies will educate and motivate respondents about the census; develop community level partnerships to get out the count; implement best practices to encourage participation among specific populations; encourage the hiring of local, trusted census enumerators; and make information and resources available to respondents filling out their census forms on the internet, a new option in 2020.  A key piece tied to the success of this work is to engage organizations embedded within and led by community.  Program activities will include outreach at events, community meetings, service-based outreach, house meetings, door-to-door canvassing and partnerships with culturally specific media. The 2020 Census will impact funding decisions for the next decade. This data informs policy, program and service decisions as they reflect how Multnomah County is changing.  Engagement and involvement of our community based organizations, especially those who are embedded within and led by populations we dont count well, is a critical piece of this complete count effort.",

This housing placement and retention strategy, often referred to as rapid rehousing is a recognized best practice and critical element of the housing placement strategies prioritized through A Home for Everyone to significantly decrease homelessness among vulnerable adults in Multnomah County.     In the 2017 Multnomah County Point in Time Count, 471 adult women were counted sleeping outside and women were one of the fastest growing groups within the overall homeless population (16.7% increase between 2015-17). In response to this growing unmet need, the JOHS increased prevention, housing placement, and shelter resources to reduce unsheltered homelessness among women. The count also revealed that women of color are disproportionately represented in the unsheltered and sheltered population. Therefore, the direction of the AHFE Executive Committee was not only to reduce homelessness among adult women, but more specifically to decrease racial disparities among homeless women.    This program continues a range of existing housing placement and retention strategies developed and coordinated through A Home for Everyone, including key elements of the housing placement capacity expansion initiated during FY 2017. These investments in rapid rehousing programs for adult households leverage significant federal, state and local resources to support the efforts of people experiencing homelessness to secure and retain permanent housing.

This program maintains current capacity to provide essential housing and developmental supports for youth, including Assertive Engagement, Parenting Education, Recovery Oriented Supports & Engagement  Assertive Engagement (case management): These services are fundamental to moving youth into independence by providing access, assessment, transition planning and support by staff that are relationship-focused, mobile, and operate throughout Multnomah County. AE staff provide linkage to education, employment, health, mental health and addictions treatment, housing services, and provide follow up care upon exit from programs.   Parenting Support: Over the last four years, HYC has seen a 25% increase in the number of youth accessing services who are pregnant and parenting. With supports on-site and at mobile locations, HYC can provide both culturally appropriate services and meet the developmental needs of pregnant and parenting youth. Housing placement funds are provided to house youth in appropriate housing options. Recovery Oriented Supports & Engagement (ROSE): For the majority of youth served, access to mental health and addiction recovery support services is essential to their housing and developmental success. 93% of youth served have either addiction or mental health issues, with 53% reporting co-occurring issues. The ROSE program provides certified staff and peer mentors who engage homeless youth in recovery supports, conduct assessments, and connect youth to formal treatment programs, provide follow up care, on-going support in group settings, and healthy recreation alternatives.  Housing: Programs provide a range of developmentally appropriate housing options. Many homeless youth lack rental histories or have other barriers to finding safe, stable housing. Housing options include onsite housing with 24 hour staffing, scattered site housing, rapid re-housing, shared, and group housing. Youth can access the options that best fit their needs and can move within the types of housing as needed. Housing navigators help youth search for best fit housing and provide retention supports.",

In order to achieve a functional end to Veteran homelessness, our community was required to build a system that could offer permanent housing to at least as many Veterans as are expected to become homeless in Multnomah County during a single year. Based on a point-in-time count conducted in January 2015, that number was estimated at 690. As of the end of December 2015, we had successfully housed 695 Veterans and by the end of 2016 more than 1,300 Veterans had returned to permanent housing. As a result of our efforts, Portland was the first West Coast city certified by the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness as having effectively ended Veteran homelessness.The capacity to house this number of Veterans depends, to a significant extent, on federal funding in the form of Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF). It also relies on a commitment of 50 Housing Choice Vouchers and 50 subsidized housing units by Home Forward. While we anticipate that federal funding will remain available in FY 2020, these federal funds are not enough to help Veterans move into housing if they have significant barriers or lack security deposit funds. The federal funds also have limitations on eviction prevention assistance, and eligibility restrictions that limit who among homeless Veterans can be served.  The flexible rent assistance and barrier mitigation funds available through this program offer allow nonprofit organizations to  assist Veterans with an array of housing services. This includes security deposits, helping with utility/past property debts, limited term rent assistance, legal fees and moving fees. ",

This program offer continues and expands supportive housing in alignment with these priorities. Supportive housing is for those who would not be successful in their housing without additional supportive services, and for whom services would be less effective without stable housing. Permanent supportive housing serves those with long-term disabilities, including chronic health conditions, mental illness and addictions, who usually have long-term or cyclical homelessness in their background.

In other cases, funds support primarily the long term rental subsidy needs of program participants, and support services are leveraged through other systems, such as the health care system. Finally, there are programs where local funds provide both the rental assistance and the bulk of the support services because of the unique needs of the subpopulation served by the program and/or the absence of other sources of support.

The program leverages support from Meyer Memorial Trust. The local long-term voucher functions more flexibly than the federal voucher program, and provides increasingly necessary ongoing rental assistance to people whose limited income otherwise excludes them entirely from the rental market. This project is testing the long-term local voucher concept by using it in a very specific circumstance  assisting people who are seniors or living with disabilities with limited fixed incomes and significant rent burdens (typically receiving income of less than $800 per month, and prior to subsidy pay more than 70% of that income to rent) to afford the rents in Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) units. Those units have rents that are restricted but they are not tied to tenant income, so they are increasingly out of reach for the target group in this pilot project. Some assisted households also reside in moderately-priced private market units. The funds make it possible for people in the target population to afford the rent (at 30% of their income). In doing so, this program would leverage the income that the target group is deriving from their federal benefits and the inventory of publicly funded affordable housing. ",

Diversion is recognized nationally and locally as a critical tool in reducing street and shelter homelessness.   Family Diversion has been a successful intervention for both preventing families from coming to emergency shelter and moving families out of shelter quickly. All families are surveyed to determine if they have an immediate housing option and, if so, diversion resources are used to help them capitalize on that opportunity.   Corrections Diversion resources are directed to people leaving incarceration through a partnership with DCJ that offers access to employment, treatment, and housing assistance resources to ensure that they do not become homeless.    DV Diversion services focus on preventing homelessness and diverting domestic violence survivors and their children from shelters through eviction prevention or housing placement. Diversion services offer flexible, rapid responses that allows survivors to avoid the trauma and safety risks of becoming homeless. These services reach hundreds of survivors annually and serve a diverse population, with 75% identifying as people of color.  Hospital Diversion partners with the hospital system to provide essential rental assistance and care coordination resources to hospital discharge workers to allow patients to discharge to housing options and not to the streets or shelter.  Transportation Program diverts individuals from the streets and shelter through one-time transportation assistance to a location where they have a verified housing option. Most commonly this program reunites individuals with family in other communities.   Benefit Assistance serves homeless and formerly homeless individuals with assistance in securing Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), and/or Medicaid and Medicare benefits. A team of disability specialists, and a workflow system with federal and local benefits agencies, streamline and expedite the application process.

		"Program Summary": "Both the City and County are committed to funding and operating long term, high quality, year-round emergency shelters, and to continue providing seasonal temporary shelter during cold weather months. Prior to the formation of the Joint Office, the City and County were faced with an unprecedented housing and homelessness crisis.  The Joint Office is guided by the shared values and the common agenda of A Home for Everyone (AHFE).  In order to have a lasting impact on the homelessness crisis, a three-pronged, balanced approach was created that included prevention, shelter expansion, as well as housing placement and retention.Initially, shelter space was sought that could be used immediately to provide safety off the streets for our most vulnerable community members. At the time, it was understood that some of the space would be shorter term, using temporarily vacant space offered by local business owners or in City or County-owned buildings, like the Hansen Building. While there is still a role for temporary seasonal shelter, we are actively working to transition all year-round shelter to higher quality facilities.  ",
